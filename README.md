# üí´ About Me:
Hello! I'm Victor, a Maritime Transport and Nautical Engineering graduate, currently in the final year of my Vocational Training in Web Development. My career path has led me to develop a strong interest in technology, particularly in web development and data analysis.

I recently earned my Microsoft Azure DP-900 certification, which sparked my passion for Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and the role of a Data Scientist/Data Engineer. I am continuously learning and exploring new technologies to apply this knowledge to real-world scenarios.
